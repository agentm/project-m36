Relational Equality

TutorialD (master/main): :showexpr s = sp

┌┐
││
└┘

# SELECT * FROM s EXCEPT SELECT * FROM sp;

ERROR:  each EXCEPT query must have the same number of columns
LINE 1: SELECT * FROM s EXCEPT SELECT * FROM sp;

Are relvars "s" and "sp" equal? No, but TutorialD and SQL provide different results.
