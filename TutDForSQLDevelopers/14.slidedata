TutorialD (master/main): :showexpr (p{weight} rename {weight as status}) join s{status}

# SELECT status FROM p JOIN s ON status = weight;

 status

(0 rows)

Rename "weight" in relvar "p" to "status" to merge matching tuples in all status values in "s" with all status values in "p" (formerly "weight").
