Database Constraints

TutorialD (master/main): foreign key s_sp_fk sp{s#} in s{s#};



ALTER TABLE sp ADD CONSTRAINT fk_s FOREIGN KEY ("s#") REFERENCES s ("s#");

Table "sp" altered.

Add a foreign key constraint between relvar "sp" and relvar "s" on the "s#" attribute. Thus, any value in "s#" from "sp" must also appear in "s#" from "s". Using set notation, this is sp{s#} âŠ† s{s#}
