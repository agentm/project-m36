SQL: Tables Are Ordered

SELECT * FROM (VALUES (1,2),(2,NULL)) as x(a,b) ORDER BY b NULLS FIRST;

 a | b 
---+---
 2 |  
 1 | 2
(2 rows)

Show me the tuple 1,2 followed by the tuple 2,NULL ordered by the "b" column with NULLs sorted first. Relations are sets of tuples- sets have no ordering. Since these tuples are ordered, we must conclude that SQL does not deal in sets nor relations.
