--caching for uncommitted transactions may be a useful, future extension, but cannot be supported here since they are not (yet) uniquely identified

{- both the key and value of this cache are relational expressions, allowing for maximum flexibility

* if a key is a partial match of a large rel expr, then it can be used
* if a value is something other than a set of tuples, it can allow for a natural compression

the cache behaves probabalistically in that there is a non-zero chance for any cache item to be removed. As the cache increases in size, the chance of an item to be removed is increased.

Project:M36 passes all results to the cache, which decides if it is worth caching based on the time it took to calculate the result and how large the result is (if it won't blow out the cache maximum level).
